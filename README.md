This is a Connect 4 engine I started writing in the fall of 2020. I used  my experience from making a <a href="https://github.com/heftyc/Sitche-CMD">chess engine</a> to create this program; all of the code is my own.
Because I have learned a lot since starting the chess engine, this program has a much cleaner design.

For extra memory efficiency this program represents a whole column in the grid with just two bytes by using one dimensional byte arrays and bitwise operators. (See <a href="https://github.com/heftyc/Connect-4-Engine/blob/master/Engine/src/Position.java"><i>Position.java</i></a>) This program also uses multithreading to calculate the best move for the AI faster. (See <a href="https://github.com/heftyc/Connect-4-Engine/blob/master/Engine/src/Opponent.java"><i>Opponent.java</i></a>)
